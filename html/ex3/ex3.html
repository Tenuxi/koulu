1. Create a HTML site with Header, Main and Footer tags.
    - Style these to fit into mobile, don't forget viewport!
    -> each element should have wide area dedicated to them in a way that it's pleasant to read on mobile, I recommend width: 100%;

2. Insert three divs into the Main Section and give them IDs and a class.

3. The first div should include a picture and a long description text below it.
    - Style them to be pleasant to read: add paddings, change font (import eg. a Google font!) and add other styling that you fancy.

4. The second div should include either a List element or a Table, this is up to you! :)
 Write some interesting content and style the Table/List as we've done before:
- add padding, change fonts, add border.

5. Add a form into the third div as well and add a table inside of it. Add rows and data cells to the table and then
 three checkboxes which tell "what" and a selection of "how many". Insert these checkboxes into the td:'s! Recommendation:
- one row includes a checkbox and a selection.
These could be eg. products and a choice from 1 to 3 on each. Add reset and submit buttons.

6. Header: add a small logo picture to the upper left corner. Add a big title (header) for the page.
Add a horizontal navigation with links to each section (a link referring to the ID of the section)

7. Add a copyright text to the Footer.

8. Make the page responsive following these steps:
    1. Add media query to handle landscape tablets and larger screens:
        - Change the first div to have the picture and the text next to each other
        (hint: felxbox might be a good idea here https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css3_flexbox.asp
        or description style="display : inline-block"; + img style="vertical-align : top")
9. Add media query to handle desktops:
        - Change the two last divs into one section on the same row (you can create an additional container div and make it as a flexbox
        or use float:right/left as we have learned.)
        - Change the background color to be the same for both of these divs.

10. Add as much fancy styling as you please!!! :)
